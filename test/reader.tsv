paper-01.pdf	Article CSFF-Net: Scene Text Detection Based on Cross-Scale Feature Fusion	Yuan Li ; Mayire Ibrayim ; Askar Hamdulla	In the last years, methods for detecting text in real scenes have made signiﬁcant progress with an increase in neural networks. However, due to the limitation of the receptive ﬁeld of the central nervous system and the simple representation of text by using rectangular bounding boxes, the previous methods may be insufﬁcient for working with more challenging instances of text. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a scene text detection network based on cross-scale feature fusion (CSFF-Net). The framework is based on the lightweight backbone network Resnet, and the feature learning is enhanced by embedding the depth weighted convolution module (DWCM) while retaining the original feature information extracted by CNN. At the same time, the 3D-Attention module is also introduced to merge the context information of adjacent areas, so as to reﬁne the features in each spatial size. In addition, because the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) cannot completely solve the interdependence problem by simple element-wise addition to process crosslayer information ﬂow, this paper introduces a Cross-Level Feature Fusion Module (CLFFM) based on FPN, which is called Cross-Level Feature Pyramid Network (Cross-Level FPN). The proposed CLFFM can better handle cross-layer information ﬂow and output detailed feature information, thus improving the accuracy of text region detection. Compared to the original network framework, the framework provides a more advanced performance in detecting text images of complex scenes, and extensive experiments on three challenging datasets validate the realizability of our approach.	feature extraction ; attention mechanism ; pyramid network ; deep learning ; text detection	en	application/pdf	Information	2021-12-17	19	9	5
paper-02.pdf	An extended winding function model for induction machine modelling considering saturation effect	Mehrdad Gholami ; Om‐Kolsoom Shahryari ; Hadi Tarimoradi	Winding function (WF) method is one of the electric machines modelling methods, which is used to simulate electric machines under different conditions. It has less simulation time and memory than other methods and, at the same time, has comparable accuracy over other methods. One of the significant challenges of WF‐based models is how to model saturation. The accuracy of the fault detection method in electric machines depends on the accuracy of the model and the method used for the simulation. A new extended model of the WF is presented for saturation modelling, which considers all parts of the core including teeth, slots, and yokes. In this method, the effect of the iron parts is emulated as a partial value that is added to the length of the actual air gap. The simulation results for normal and faulty conditions are shown in two cases, with and without considering saturation effect. Then the importance of saturation modelling has been demonstrated. Simulation is done in MATLAB software. Moreover, the experimental results are shown to verify the proposed model.		en	application/pdf	John Wiley $ Sons	2020-09-17	13	15	0
